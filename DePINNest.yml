  reward:
    model: >-
      Nodes earn DPN tokens based on uptime, charging activity, and verified energy data.
      Rewards simulate how decentralized EV charging stations can generate
      on-chain incentives for network participation.
    distribution: >-
      Rewards are distributed proportionally based on node performance and
      verified contributions using Solana smart contract logic.
    token: DPN (DePINNest Token)
    frequency: Every 24 hours (simulated)
